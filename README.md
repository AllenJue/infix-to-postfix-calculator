# infix-to-postfix-calculator
A postfix calculator that utilizes Java Swing and an infix to postfix algorithm to process user-inputted mathematical expressions to calculate a numeric value.

# Reason
I wanted to get some experience with creating a GUI, and Java Swing was an easily-accessible and manageable way to implement a calculator GUI. This project helped me learn how to use event listeners and learn how to implement the shunting-yard algorithm (infix to postfix) to preprocess user-inputed expressions to be computer readable.

# Future improvements
- Add event listeners to keyboard keys to make it easier for clients to input expressions
- Make implicit multiplication and division with parenthesis
- Add other operations (log, sin, cos, tan, ..., etc)
